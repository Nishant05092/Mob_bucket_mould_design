## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves the **end-to-end design of an injection mould** for a **MOB (Moulded Open Bucket)** used in domestic and industrial applications.

The design workflow includes:
- Product (bucket) analysis  
- Core–cavity development  
- Runner & gate system design  
- Cooling channel layout  
- Ejection mechanism  
- Complete mould assembly  

The final design follows **DFM (Design for Manufacturing)** principles and is suitable for **high-volume plastic injection moulding**.
